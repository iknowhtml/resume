        <p>
          I am a Full Stack Engineer with a passion for technology and innovation, in particular the web and distributed
          software systems. I offer two years of professional experience in
          full stack development from
          conception
          to delivery of performant and maintainable solutions using functional
          programming paradigms in an Agile
          environment. My expertise range from designing and implementing responsive and
          user-friendly UX/UIs to
          scalable and fault-tolerant infrastructures. In particular, I specialize in
          full stack development using the React and Node.js ecosystems, as well as cloud-native and distributed
          architectures
          using Docker and Kubernetes.
