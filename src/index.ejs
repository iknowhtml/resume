          I am a Full Stack JavaScript Engineer with a passion for technology and
          innovation, In particular the web and distributed systems. I offer three years of professional experience in
          full stack web application development from
          conception
          to delivery of performant and maintainable solutions using functional
          programming paradigms and test driven development in an Agile
          environment. My expertise range from designing and implementing responsive and
          user-friendly UX/UIs to
          scalable and fault-tolerant event-driven microservice infrastructures. In particular, I specialize in
          web application
          development using the React and Node.js ecosystems, as well as cloud native and container-based architectures
          using Docker and Kubernetes.
