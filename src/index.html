      <h2>Profile</h2>
      <div class="section-container">
        <p>
          Staff software engineer with 10+ years of experience building institutional-grade financial infrastructure, custody platforms, and developer tooling.

          I specialize in systems where failure is unacceptable: permissions, governance, settlement, auditability, and execution guarantees. I’ve led initiatives end-to-end—from protocol and library design through production infrastructure—translating regulatory, operational, and technical constraints into reliable, maintainable systems.
          
          I operate as a hands-on technical leader, setting direction through design, reviews, and execution. I mentor engineers to think in systems, reason from first principles, and deliver high-impact work in ambiguous, institution-facing environments.
