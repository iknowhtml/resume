        <p>
          I am a software engineer with
          a
          passion for
          creating products that empower people and democratize technology. I believe in the power of leveraging
          compassionate design based on first-principles to drive product and
          engineering practices.
          I offer over 3 years of professional experience in
          software development using functional programming/object-oriented paradigms and event-driven architectures in
          Agile
          environments.
          My areas of expertise are in front end, UX/UI, and digital accessibility, and my interests
          include
          functional
          programming, blockchain, and engineering
          productivity/leadership.
