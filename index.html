          <h2>Profile</h2>
          <p>I am a JavaScript developer with a passion for technology and innovation, in particular Blockchain and the Web.
          I offer two years of experience in full stack web application development from conception through design, architecture and delivery of elegant and maintainable solutions.
          My personal mission is to use technology and entreprenership to create a more compassionate and humancentric future by empowering people to connect more meaningfully and reducing socioeconomic inequality. 
          My experiences and expertise range from designing and implementing responsive and user-friendly web-based UX/UIs to architecting and developing modular, scalable and fault-tolerant back end infrastructures.
          Specifically, I specialize in web application development using the React and Node.js ecosystems.</p>
