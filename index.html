My work focuses on systems where correctness, security, and trust matter—permissions, governance, settlement, auditability, and execution guarantees—while still delivering intuitive and delightful user experiences. I’ve led initiatives end-to-end, from product and UX design through backend systems and production deployments, translating regulatory, operational, and technical constraints into reliable, maintainable software. I operate as a hands-on technical leader, emphasizing clarity, ownership, and practical feedback. I enjoy mentoring engineers, raising the quality bar through example, and helping teams ship high-impact work in fast-moving, ambiguous environments.</p></div></section><section id="work-experience"><h2>Work Experience</h2><div class="section-container"><section><span><h3>Ava Labs - <em>Staff Software Engineer / Team Tech Lead, </em>Remote</h3><time>February 2023 - Present</time></span><ul><li>Lead the Experience Platform engineering team, and collaborate with senior leadership and cross-functional teams on hiring and business objectives.</li><li>Evolve internal tooling into institutional-grade digital asset management platform, implementing product re-branding of the web UI, transactions support across multiple blockchains, authentication/authorization/governance, integration with MPC infrastructure, and migration of the web app from CSR to SSR with BFF & external APIs capablilities to K8s .</li><li>Spearhead AI initiatives by creating comprehensive codebase documentation, implementing code quality guardrails, and automated code review systems, achieving 40% of committed code from AI.</li><li>Partner with finance team to optimize digital asset operations, achieving 98% utilization of stakeable assets, $50M+ in tax savings, and 2000% increase in transaction velocity through internal tooling.</li></ul></section><section><span><h3>Coral - <em>Co-Founder & Head of Engineering, </em>Remote</h3><time>September 2021 - February 2023</time></span><ul><li>Led engineering for digital asset marketplace and affiliate/referral platform for musicians on Avalanche C-Chain, securing $500K seed investment from Avalaunch, Status, and Wave Financial.</li><li>Architected low-friction social login with non-custodial wallets (83% adoption) and credit card NFT minting (91% usage), while managing the engineering team and third-party design services.</li></ul></section><section><span><h3>User1st - <em>Senior Full Stack Developer / Solutions Architect - R&D, </em>Remote</h3><time>January 2020 - February 2023</time></span><ul><li>Architected & implemented 8 accessibility NPM packages, and modernized build tooling to reduce deployment time by 75%, startup by 95%, build by 80%, and engineering onboarding by 90%.</li><li>Retained $1M+ in contracts (Amtrak, T-Mobile) through customer liaison, platform integrations, and accessibility compliance QA.</li></ul></section><section><span><h3>Independent Web3 &amp; Blockchain Consulting - <em>Principal</em>, Hybrid</h3><time>November 2017 - September 2020</time></span><ul><li>Led re-design of Dexible's dApp, delivering a new design system and component library, and complete UX/UI rehaul of the web app.</li><li>Provided blockchain consulting for Alluminate and CryptoPets, implementing client portals, wallet integrations, and blockchain infrastructure, as well as conducted smart contract audits & technical due diligence.</li></ul></section><section><span><h3>Booz Allen Hamilton - <em>Technologist, </em>Washington D.C.
